# Graphs
Project written in C++, provides the parameters of a given graph.

1. the degree sequence;
2. the number of components;
3. bipartiteness;
4. the eccentricity of vertices (within the components) X
5. planarity X
6. vertices colours (consecutive natural numbers from 1) obtained using algorithms:\
   6a. greedy (the vertex order according to its number)\
   6b. LF method (ties are solved by the vertex number)\
   6c. SLF method (ties are solved by highest vertex degree, and if there is still a tie choose the vertex with the lowest number) X
7. the number of different C4 subgraphs X
8. the number of the graph complement's edges

X means this part was not completed.
